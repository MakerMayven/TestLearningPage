**What is 3D Printing?**
**Introduction to 3D printing**
3D printing is a manufacturing process where successive layers of material are laid down on top of each other in an additive process.

The 3D printing process was devised in the 1980s and originally known as ‘rapid prototyping’. It enabled companies to develop prototypes quickly and more accurately than with other methods. After over 30 years of innovation, its uses are far more diverse today.

Manufacturers, engineers, designers, educators, medics, and hobbyists alike use the technology for a huge range of applications.

There are various types of 3D printers that work using different technologies and materials. However, all 3D printers have something in common – they all build up an object layer by layer. Let’s take a look at 4 popular 3D printing methods:

1. FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication)

FFF 3D printers work by melting plastic filament and depositing it onto a print bed, where it solidifies. Additional layers are printed on top of each other until the model is complete. Types of plastic include PLA, ABS and composites that combine plastic with wood, copper, bronze and several others.

2. SLA/DLP (Stereolithography/Digital Light Processing)

SLA/DLP machines utilise light sources to cure a liquid photopolymer. A print bed is generally submerged in resin and the light is used to solidify certain areas. Once a layer has solidified the print bed will move, allowing the light to cure the next layer.

3. SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)

Selective Laser Sintering works in a similar manner to SLA/DLP technologies but the light source (laser) is used to fuse powdered material together. The most common material for SLS printers is the thermoplastic polymer nylon. SLS technology can produce parts with a very high accuracy.

4. Material Jetting

Material jetting uses a similar technology to a standard inkjet printer. The difference being that the material used is a liquid photopolymer that is cured by a UV light source once it hits the print bed. Material jetting opens up new opportunities in producing multi-material and multi-colour objects.

Additive vs Subtractive Manufacturing
Due to the layer by layer process of 3D printers, they generally produce very little waste material. Subtractive manufacturing methods (CNC machining, laser cutting etc) cut away at a block of material to create the desired part. Take a look at the below models in the interactive viewer. Here are some tips in how to navigate around the models:

Left-click and drag to rotate your view
Scroll your mouse wheel up and down to zoom in and out
Hold down your mouse wheel button whilst dragging to pan across
With 3D printing, the desired part can be created by using only the material required for the pyramid. If the model was to be created using subtractive methods, there would be a substantial amount of waste material created (as highlighted in the ‘waste’ model) below.



One of the factors affecting the amount of waste is the shape of the desired part, in particular forms with thin structures that span in multiple directions. For example, a tree trunk with thin branches that span across a long distance. The reason this would create a large amount of waste is because a large block of material would be required to cover the long spanning model, but most of this would be cut out as waste because the branches are thin with minimal volume.
